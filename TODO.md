# UI

- [-] The house image on the detail page on the desktop screen does not have a fixed width, which result in smaller images not looking well. Also, the recommendations should be placed next to the house details on desktop.
- [ ] not deleting houses properly after unsuccessful image upload
- [ ] make home page header stack
- [ ] fix borders of search category list -[ ] clear text search
- [ ] navbar order

# Logic

- [-] It's not possible to submit a house when uploading a jpg file. Please take a look at the docs. **_ Added support for jpeg_**
- [-] When editing a house, the image is not shown. **_ werks on my machine_**
